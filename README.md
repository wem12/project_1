# My First Project
This is my first project using GitHub and Cursor/VS Code!
# Project Name
SportsVest - Sports Team Investment Platform

## Project Description
A Robinhood-inspired web application that allows fans and investors to purchase official ownership stakes in sports teams. Teams can authorize these stakes to generate liquidity and additional revenue, while investors can purchase shares both as financial investments and as a form of team support. Share prices are initially determined by fair value team valuations with trading premiums, then fluctuate based on real-time trading data and market forces. Returns are primarily provided through team-based perks and exclusive access, with optional end-of-season cash dividends for long-term holders.
